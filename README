Default Admin User Login Details

Username      Password
admin-admin   cannot delete me          (spaces including)

Functionality Details
-----------------------
1) All the required functionality put up in the Problem Definition has been provided.

2) You can sign in using the default admin user credentials mentioned above or you can "Sign Up" 
to create new users.

3) The question text that you will see on the main homepage will be a link.
By clicking on this post-specific link, you will be taken to a post-specific page where you can post a reply, 
vote up the original post, vote up the already posted replies etc. 

4) Decay Factor: We consider decay factor as a combination of number of votes received by a post 
and the timestamp associated with the creation time of the post.

5) User Statistics: We display "Number of Posts by a User", "Number of Votes by this user"
and "Number of Votes for the posts (including replies) that this user made"
The third factor mentioned above can be used as an indicator for measuring up the usefullness
of the questions asked by the user and rpelies posted to other users. This sort of mimicks
the "points" feature of stackoverflow.


How we (think we) stand out
-----------------------------
1) We have tried to make our site resemble as much as possible to the stackoverflow site.
2) The "Users" link will display all the users currently registered into the system. 
3) Since the decay factor metric displays only Top Questions asked in recent history, 
we also have an "All Questions" link which will display exhaustively all the questions.
